        Princess: We shall require your skill to heal the wounds
        Of those that fall.<br>

        Sach.: (Alarmed) What, heal the wounded?<br>

        Princess: Yes!<br>

        Sach.: And cut off real live legs and arms?<br>

        Princess: Of course!<br>

        Sach.: I wouldn't do it for a thousand pounds!<br>
